Assignment questions:

# Reflections

**Please mention the requirements you met and which goals you achieved for this assignment.**

_Correct use of semantic HTML elements, including header, footer, nav._

- I included all of these elements in my page.

_Correct use of CSS absolute positioning for overlaying text_

- I used absolute positioning within a relative positioning parent div on my "next section" links.

_Correct use of CSS Flexbox for layout and nav links._

- I used CSS flexbox for the overall structure of the page and most positioning of elements.

_Correct use of image elements and file paths to image files_

- I correctly linked a number of images in my site.

_Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve?_

- More of a personal goal but I kinda wanted to put some javascript on the site for nice animations etc.

_If so, could you please tell us what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?_

- I found it quite difficult to keep track of all the IDs and classes and how they interact. I'd like to get better at planning out the styles, I feel like I dealt with the structure in the HTML quite well at least.

**(Optional)**
**Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission e.g.**

_What went really well and what could have gone better?_

- I built out the structure and basic CSS styling quite quickly, but it took some time to figure out how to properly implement the background images I chose. In the end I found "background-blend-mode: lighten;" combines with a background colour and can be used to reduce opacity and other effects on the background image.

- I'm happy with the navbar and the smooth scrolling through the site, although the site does look rather old-fashioned. I'm hoping to improve on that through the course.

- Another thing I would do differently next time is probably not use 3 x flex column divs for each page, it made positioning elements a little harder and also made the final site a little too repetitive to look at.

_Detailing useful external sources that helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials)._

- MDN, W3schools, google, pexels were the main sources of info I used.

_Describing errors or bugs you encountered while completing your assignment._

- Manny helped to solve a bug with the fixed position navbar, the divs for the top section were overlapping the links when scrolling through the page. To solve this, the header was given a Z-index of 1 to force it to be the top element in the page, since no other z-indexes were defined.

- The site only looks as intended on a desktop monitor currently.

Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.

- Are there "best practices" when it comes to the way classes and IDs are assigned to HTML elements? I feel like there are many many ways to do it and I'd like to be more consistent going forward.

# MY PLAN

Wireframe on okso

Topic: facts about the london underground
Think of colour scheme (white blue red)

    1. Make all the elements using html
    2. layout using flexbox
    3. Add content
    4. Style using CSS
    5. Think of ideas for some basic JS if I have time

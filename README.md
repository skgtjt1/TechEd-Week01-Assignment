Assignment questions:

# Reflections

**Please mention the requirements you met and which goals you achieved for this assignment.**

_Correct use of semantic HTML elements, including header, footer, nav._

- I included all of these elements in my page.

_Correct use of CSS absolute positioning for overlaying text_

- I used absolute positioning within a relative positioning parent div on my "next page" links.

_Correct use of CSS Flexbox for layout and nav links._

- I used CSS flexbox for the overall structure of the page and most positioning of elements.

_Correct use of image elements and file paths to image files_

- I correctly linked a number of images in my site.

_Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve?_

- More of a personal goal but I kinda wanted to put some javascript on the site for nice animations etc.

_If so, could you please tell us what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?_

- I found it quite difficult to keep track of all the IDs and classes and how they interact. I'd like to get better at planning out the styles, I feel like I dealt with the structure in the HTML quite well at least.

**(Optional)**
**Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission e.g.**

_What went really well and what could have gone better?_

- I built out the structure and basic CSS styling quite quickly, but it took some time to figure out how to properly implement the background images I chose. In the end I found "background-blend-mode: lighten;" combines with a background colour and can be used to reduce opacity and other effects on the background image.

_Detailing useful external sources that helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials)._

-MDN, W3schools, google, pexels were the main sources of info I used.

_Describing errors or bugs you encountered while completing your assignment._

-

Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.
